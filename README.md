**What is Blcktopia?**

The blcktopia is a educational project build to teach about blockchain and web3 for peripheral communities.
Our objective is include vulnerabilized social groups that don't access yet this ecossystem and that can use the decentralized technologies to improve and conquer social justice, politic empowerment, equality and discover a new world for economic solutions.

This objective we called like an _utopia_ a huge pretension that we are willing to provocate.

**Why peripheral communities**?

_The Problem_

Public safety data from Brazil show that black and peripheral communities are victims of a structural genocide¹, while school dropouts increase every year and the chances of a small business going bankrupt in less than 04 years is 50%².
On other hand, the structure of the financial market is not able to promote the inclusion while the actual politic models to administrate the public goods are too insuficients and excludents.

_Potential_

Studies shows that the brazilian peripheral communities moves around R$120 billions for year³. That is estimated that around 13,6 million of persons lives in brazilian favelas. This data show the potential that the blockchain ecosystem can find in this local, acessing a market that dont be absorbed by the centralized financial systems and a community of users that dont knows yet the web3.
For other side, a recent study of the Coinjournal shows that the brazilian are the 6th bigger population that uses crypto in the world.

**The Project**

This project starts in september of 2022, in a partnership with the Hip Hop House, located in the Taquaril's Favela, one the biggest and more vulnerable community in Belo Horizonte, capital of Minas Gerais. In this experience we talk about how tokenization can improve the culture and art production. We talk about how the Hip Hop House that has an important social assistance role in the community can take advantage of tokenization, web3 and the creation of governance.

There were four classes that can be checked on our [update page](https://www.notion.so/blckdao/Hip-Hop-House-f3ce6e54a0e949268ef286a4474bfbfe), at the end of the course all participating students received a certificate of participation.

Then we go to an another peripheral community, this time, Morro do Papagaio, a big favela in the heart of the city, in a partnership of the Movement Eu Amo Minha Quebrada.

In this class, we talk for about blockchain and web3 for kids, talking about future, profesional alternatives and how the tokenization can open doors for community, show them how we can use tokenization for agregated the products and services produced in the local small business.

There is the [update](https://www.notion.so/blckdao/Papagaio-EuAmoMinhaQuebrada-1-3c15f379d9a048f09bf37ed3f7016de8) of this edition.

**And Now?**

We gonna create a interligated ecosystem across the communities, improving the tokenization and blockchain adoption, turning people in users of the web3, creating economic solution to create products and services.

The peripheral communities are resposible to create a huge amount of product and services, but they dont are recognized in financial terms, the tokenization and a strong ecosystem can allow the trade of services between communities, like attract other persons and stimulate the investment from outside the community.
