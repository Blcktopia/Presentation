**What is Blcktopia?**

The blcktopia is a educational project build to teach about blockchain and web3 for peripheral communities.
Our objective is include vulnerabilized social groups that don't access yet this ecossystem and that can use the decentralized technologies to improve and conquer social justice, politic empowerment, equality and discover a new world for economic solutions.

This objective we called like an _utopia_ a huge pretension that we are willing to provocate.

**Why peripheral communities**?

_The Problem_

Public safety data from Brazil show that black and peripheral communities are victims of a structural genocide, while school dropouts increase every year and the chances of a small business going bankrupt in less than 04 years is 50%.
On other hand, the structure of the financial market is not able to promote the inclusion while the actual politic models to administrate the public goods are too insuficients and excludents.

_Potential_

Studies shows that the brazilian peripheral communities moves around R$120 billions for year. That is estimated that around 13,6 million of persons lives in brazilian favelas. This data show the potential that the blockchain ecosystem can find in this local, acessing a market that dont be absorbed by the centralized financial systems and a community of users that dont knows yet the web3.
For other side, a recent study of the Coinjournal shows that the brazilian are the 6th bigger population that uses crypto in the world.
